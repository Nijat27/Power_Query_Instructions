    "# Merge Columns in Power Query\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Merging columns in Power Query allows you to combine data from multiple columns into a single column. This is useful for creating unique identifiers, full names, or other combined values. This guide provides general steps for merging columns and highlights key considerations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Import Data into Power Query\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Select the Dataset:**\n",
    "   - Place your cursor within the dataset you want to work with.\n",
    "   - Right-click and select `Get Data from Table/Range`.\n",
    "   - Ensure the table has headers and the \"marching ants\" encompass the entire dataset.\n",
    "   - Click `OK`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Merging Columns in Power Query\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method 1: Transform and Merge Columns (Removes Source Columns)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Open the Power Query Editor:**\n",
    "   - With your data loaded in Power Query, go to the `Transform` tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Select Columns to Merge:**\n",
    "   - Hold down the `Ctrl` key and select the columns you want to merge in the desired order (e.g., `Department` and `ID`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Merge Columns:**\n",
    "   - Click `Merge Columns`.\n",
    "   - Choose a separator (e.g., hyphen).\n",
    "   - For custom separators, select `Custom` and type the desired separator (e.g., `-`).\n",
    "   - Click `OK`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Result:**\n",
    "   - The selected columns are merged into a new column, and the original columns are removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method 2: Add and Merge Columns (Keeps Source Columns)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Open the Power Query Editor:**\n",
    "   - With your data loaded in Power Query, go to the `Add Column` tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Select Columns to Merge:**\n",
    "   - Hold down the `Ctrl` key and select the columns you want to merge in the desired order (e.g., `Department` and `ID`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Merge Columns:**\n",
    "   - Click `Merge Columns`.\n",
    "   - Choose a separator (e.g., hyphen).\n",
    "   - For custom separators, select `Custom` and type the desired separator (e.g., `-`).\n",
    "   - Click `OK`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Result:**\n",
    "   - A new column is created with the merged data, and the original columns are retained.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method 3: Custom Column (Handles Different Data Types)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Open the Power Query Editor:**\n",
    "   - With your data loaded in Power Query, go to the `Add Column` tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create a Custom Column:**\n",
    "   - Click `Custom Column`.\n",
    "   - Enter the new column name (e.g., `FullNameID`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Write the Formula:**\n",
    "   - Use the Power Query formula language to combine columns:\n",
    "     - Example: `=[LastName] & \" \" & Text.From([ID])`\n",
    "   - Ensure text and numeric data types are compatible (convert numbers to text if necessary).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Handle Errors:**\n",
    "   - If you encounter errors, edit the custom column formula to ensure proper data type conversion:\n",
    "     - Example: `Text.From([ID])` to convert ID to text.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Result:**\n",
    "   - The custom column is created based on the specified formula, and the original columns are retained.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Review and Adjust:**\n",
    "   - Check the new column for accuracy and make any necessary adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Close and Load Data:**\n",
    "   - Once the data is prepared, click `Close & Load`.\n",
    "   - Choose `Close & Load To` if you want to specify the load location:\n",
    "     - **Existing Worksheet:** Select a specific cell in the current workbook.\n",
    "     - **New Worksheet:** Load the data into a new worksheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, you can effectively merge columns in Power Query, ensuring your data is combined as needed while maintaining control over whether the original columns are kept or removed.\n"
